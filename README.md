The start of my SPD 1.2 Project to create the front end of a Project idea.
Idea: Fav Tracker thing
- Allows people to keep track of their shows, books, movies, etc.

USE flask run 
to open / run the website locally and to see it in its full glory.

Github hosting link does not work well with the site as it doesn't use the APP file
- Lose most of the styling this way
- The links don't work this way either
